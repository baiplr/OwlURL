Linkie is a very simple URL Shortener made in PHP that uses a MySQL Database to store links and a .htaccess to perform the handling of links.

## Quick Start
1. Download the Source Code
2. Upload to your web directory
3. Create a database for OwlURL
4. Create a table inside named 'links'
5. Add an auto incrementing ID column, a url TEXT column, and a title VARCHAR with a length of 32
5. Modify the MySQL Connection function inside index.php
6. Done!

## Development
Currently, I am looking to develop the system further, and I will look into creating better styling and possibly an admin panel where you can manage links and delete some.
